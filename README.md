# First practice with Javascript
This is the first practice I've done with Javascript.

# Classroom management practice
It is console based program where you can choose between a set of options to interact with an array of students.

# About this practice and Javascript

In this practice I've been able to get used to Javascript syntax. 
I've been working since the beginning of the Bootcamp with Python so in this practice I had the opportunity to research and get familiar with the language.
This has been my first approach to Javascript and I couldn't be more intrigued about all the things I could do once I get the hang of it.
Due to my interest for web development, I will be posting regularly more projects in order to improve my skills.
__This is just the first project of many more to come!__
